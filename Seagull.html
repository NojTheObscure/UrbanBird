<p>There’s no doubting you’ve seen and heard these guys at your local dump or round the back of your chippy. It’s probably the Herring Gull. They will even hang around cities or places with very little water, over the years they have moved inland and can be found everywhere. They hang around in a flock which has a pecking order, they keep their distance from one another but do “operate” together. Like the Corvids they have a rather complex language and social structure. They’re “language” only seems works in the present tense but can include complex commands like “follow me” and “I will share this food”. They are approachable but they are not tame! They rarely attack but are not afraid of humans and will take food out your hands or grab available food out your bag!
