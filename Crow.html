<p>You have seen them, on the side of the road, on the way to the bus top, it’s a crow thing. There are a few different ones out there though, the one you are likely looking at is a Carrion Crow. Like all corvids carrion crows show intelligent behaviour. For example, they can discriminate between numerosities up to 30, flexibly switch between rules, and recognise human and crow faces. In other words they’re pretty smart, they can count, they can change their minds about things and they know who you are.  Like other Corvids around humans, they can become “tame”, which means you can interact with them. You can find them in all sorts of areas, they roost in a main site usually in trees, they come out to feed, scavenge and socialise.</p><img src="Crow_image1.jpg"/>
